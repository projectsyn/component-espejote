== icon:bug[] Steps for debugging

=== Check what triggers the reconciles

[source]
----
sum by(exported_namespace,managedresource,trigger) (rate(espejote_reconciles_total{exported_namespace="MR_NAMESPACE",managedresource="MR_NAME"}[10m]))
----

Check which trigger is causing the reconciles.
You might constantly update a resource that is used as a trigger.
If the trigger name is empty, the trigger is the managed resource itself getting updated.

You can watch the trigger resource and check what is changing:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get <TRIGGER_KIND> -n <TRIGGER_NAMESPACE> -w -oyaml
----
